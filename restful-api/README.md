0. Basics of HTTP/HTTPS
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Background:
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It allows web clients (like browsers) to communicate with web servers. HTTP has evolved over time and has a secure counterpart called HTTPS (HTTP Secure). HTTPS is just like HTTP but with an added layer of security using SSL/TLS encryption. This layer protects the data from eavesdroppers and tampering.

Objective:
At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

Differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS.
Understand the basic working and structure of HTTP requests and responses.
Recognize and explain the common HTTP methods and status codes.


1. Consume data from an API using command line tools (curl)
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Background:
curl (Client URL) is a command-line tool that allows users to transfer data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more). It’s widely used for debugging, testing, and interacting with RESTful web services and APIs. By mastering curl, one can quickly prototype API requests, diagnose server issues, and more, all from the command line.

Objective:
At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

Install and use curl from the command line.
Construct and execute basic API requests using curl, including setting headers and inspecting the output.
Interpret the results of common API requests.

2. Consuming and processing data from an API using Python
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Background:
Python, due to its readability and a vast library ecosystem, is a popular choice for interacting with web services and APIs. The requests library simplifies HTTP communication and allows users to send HTTP requests using Python. Once the data is fetched, Python’s built-in libraries and tools enable effortless data manipulation and processing.


3. Develop a simple API using Python with the `http.server` module
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Background:
The http.server module in Python’s standard library provides basic classes for implementing web servers. While it’s not typically used for production applications, it’s a handy tool for building simple web servers and understanding the basics of web programming without relying on third-party libraries.

Objective:
At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

Set up a basic web server using the http.server module.
Handle different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
Serve JSON data in response to specific endpoints.


4. Develop a Simple API using Python with Flask
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Background:
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, which is especially popular for creating small to medium web applications and RESTful APIs. Its minimalist and modular approach makes it a great choice for beginners to delve into web development without the overhead of more complex frameworks.

Objective:
At the end of this exercise, students should be able to: 1. Set up a Flask application and run a development server. 2. Define and handle routes with Flask to respond to different endpoints. 3. Serve JSON data using Flask. 4. Understand the basics of request handling and response formation in Flask. 5. Handle POST requests to add new data to the API.

5. API Security and Authentication Techniques
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Background:
API security is of paramount importance, especially when the API is exposed to the wider internet. There are many risks, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and denial-of-service attacks. One fundamental method of securing APIs is to use authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access certain resources.

Objective:
At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

Understand the importance of API security.
Implement basic authentication using Flask.
Set up token-based authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Differentiate between authentication and authorization.
