Background:
Docker volumes are a mechanism to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Unlike a bind mount, which mounts any directory from the host into the container, a volume is entirely managed by Docker. Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts, such as easier backup and migration, and are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

Objective:
Modify your existing Dockerfile to include a specified volume at /data. Demonstrate the persistence of data in this volume by:

Writing data to the volume.
Stopping the container.
Restarting the container.
Reading the data back from the volume to confirm its persistence.

Instructions:
Dockerfile Modification:

You’ll use your existing Dockerfile from the “Simple Docker Image” task.
Use the VOLUME directive to specify a volume at the /data path.
Building the Docker Image:

Build the Docker image with a suitable tag, e.g., docker build -t my-data-container ..
Running the Docker Container:

Run a container from the image, ensuring that you map a local directory to the /data volume for data persistence, e.g., docker run -v local_data_directory:/data my-data-container.
Demonstrating Data Persistence:

Write data to the volume, e.g., echo 'Hello, Docker Volumes!' > /data/hello.txt.
Stop the container using docker stop [container_id].
Restart the container using docker start [container_id].
Read the data back from the volume and confirm it matches the original data, e.g., cat /data/hello.txt.
Notes:

Ensure the local directory you map to the /data volume is kept consistent across container restarts to demonstrate persistence.
You might want to use a simple script or Docker command-line interface to write and read data for easier demonstration.
